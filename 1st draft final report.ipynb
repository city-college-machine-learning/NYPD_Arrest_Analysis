    "Understanding, examining and analyzing the arrests data in New York City for the year 2019. Which were the highest level of Crimes committed that warranted an arrest? Was it felonies or misdemeanors ? Which factors would more likely contribute to an arrest, and which Borough might be the safest?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ABSTRACT\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we all reside in New York City which happens to be ranked # 25 for most violent crimes in the United States of America, it is imperative in the name of safety to use our knowledge as aspiring Data Scientist to delve into the data to see what can be unearth in trying to understand the who’s, how’s and why. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a population of approximately 6,068, 009 persons over 18 years old in New York, there were 213,089 arrests made in 2019, a mere 3.5 % of the population. This information is useful for understanding the bigger picture of how to measure the crime situation on a scale from 1 to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "After normalizing the data to ensure that there were no biases or disparity between the proportions of race in conjunction with the Boroughs, it was found that 47.86 % of blacks were arrested, followed by 25% white Hispanics during the year 2019. The borough of Brooklyn saw 27.25 % arrests, the highest numbers, with Manhattan following closely with 25 %, and the Bronx respectively with 23%. From the analysis Staten Island had the least amount of arrests, a mere 5%, which suggests that it was the safest borough during the year 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assaults and related offenses were the most frequently occurring level of offense, with the Bronx having the highest number of arrests in that category, followed by Manhattan and Brooklyn.  Overall, there were by far more misdemeanors (minor wrong doings), 59.41%, followed by felonies 39.07% (more violent crimes), then violations with 1.32%. To get a better understanding of why these disproportionate number came to be, a wider range of data would have had to be collected, including education level, economic status, opportunity reach etc. in the relevant neighborhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the analysis shows there were more arrests in January, the worst single day in terms of number of arrests occurred on May 2nd, 2019, with 877 arrests.  This finding was unexpected since one would expect more arrests to be made during the warm, sunny, and more comfortable months (June, July, August and early September), when more individuals are outdoors. Looking at weather.com data on that day, the day with the highest number of arrests, trying to find answers as to why, it showed that it was 77 degrees Fahrenheit and cloudy. It was however a more comfortable day overall compared to the previous days with 60, 59, and 55 degrees Fahrenheit respectively. In such a case is easy to assume that because of the reasonably lovely day, with all the excitement, more people came out, and more arrests were made. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Logistic Regression algorithm with 61% precision, 62% recall, and 57% F1 score was the best performing algorithm that predicted whether the level of crime was that of a misdemeanor or that of a felony,  trained and tested with the features,  age group, race, sex, borough of the arrested and precinct where the arrest occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Since safety is top priority for most of us, knowing and understanding the arrest statistics and causes of crimes in our environment, surrounding neighborhoods, and State should be of paramount importance. With this in mind, we decided to research, analyze, interpret, and make predictions using the New York Police Department’s Arrest dataset for the year 2019.  It was also cited in the USA Today article, Dangerous States, Jan 2020, that New York ranks # 25 in the United States list of cities with the most violent crime rates, so that made the choice of looking at the crime situation even more compelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NYPD’s arrest dataset is comprised of eighteen (18) features, ranging from the perpetrators age group, race, sex, arrest borough, level of arrest, offense description, arrest precinct, arrest date and other closely related data. The arrest data is collected from the five boroughs in New York, namely Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island. Preliminary analysis determined that Staten island had the least amount of crimes, and as such was deemed the safest borough in 2019, followed by Manhattan, the Bronx and Queens. On the other hand, Brooklyn saw the highest number of arrests, with Misdemeanor having the highest ranking with reference to the level of offense. \n",
    "\n",
    "After undertaking the task of cleaning the data as a part of the exploratory data analysis process, varying visualization tools were created to highlight and present important finding and summaries for all features and data. These visualizations will range from showing several bar graphs and charts laced with very important and interesting findings, that will be used to answer fundamentals of how, why, when and who questions. In addition to examining and trying to make sense of the data, we will also test several machine learning algorithms to ascertain the one with the best performance for making our prediction on which level of offence (felony, misdemeanor) is more likely to occur given characteristics such as age, race, gender, borough, and precinct of the arrestee.\n",

    "The data was collected from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc, open source data. Each record represents an arrest effected in NYC by the NYPD and includes information about the type of crime, the location, date of the enforcement and the suspects demographics.\n",
